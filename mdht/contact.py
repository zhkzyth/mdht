    Encapsulate a BitTorrent DHT node

    Each DHT node has a unique (to the network) node_id and an ipv4
    address. This class further keeps track of node statistics
    such as whether this node is considered to be fresh (active, sending
    valid queries and responses) and whether this node is better than
    another node (in terms of average rtt, freshness, etc.) Statistics
    are collected when the successful_query and failed_query
    methods are called

                        0 <= node_id < 2**160

                    seconds since the unix epoch : float)

                    including successful and failed
    successcount:   The number of queries to which this node has responded
    failcount:      The number of queries to which this node has failed
                    (either by sending an Error, or by timing out)
